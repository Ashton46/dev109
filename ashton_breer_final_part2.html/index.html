    <h1>Web Development Final Reflection</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
            <p>Before this class, I had basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, such as structuring a webpage and styling elements. However, my experience with JavaScript was minimal, limited to simple scripts for form validation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h3>
            <p>I built my portfolio from scratch. I chose this approach to challenge myself and to gain a deeper understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. It also allowed me to customize the design to my preferences.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h3>
            <p>The most challenging part of my portfolio was the CSS. Ensuring that the layout was responsive and looked good on different devices required a lot of testing and adjustments. Flexbox and media queries were particularly tricky to master.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h3>
            <p>This class gave me a new appreciation for the complexity and creativity involved in web development. I learned that web development is not just about coding, but also about problem-solving and designing user-friendly interfaces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
            <p>I would recommend future students to start working on their projects early and to not hesitate to seek help from the instructor and peers. Practicing coding regularly and reviewing course materials consistently will make the learning process smoother.</p>
