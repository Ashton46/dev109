    <h1>Web Development Final Reflection</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
            <p>Before this class, I had no knowledge with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I haven't taken any coding classes either. At the beggining of this class it was very overwhelming at the beginning of the class as we were moving through topics very quickly. Once I got a good base understanding, everything was more manageable. 
.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h3>
            <p>I did use the template that was given to us for the midterm. I just carried over the template from teh midterm to my final project. The template was very useful as it had a set consistent structure throughout the website. I felt that having a template was very valuable to make the website look professional and pass the usability and accessibility test. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h3>
            <p>The most challenging part of my portfolio was the CSS. Ensuring that the layout looked right was very important. Making sure the design was responsive and user-friendly required a lot of attention to detail and iterative testing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h3>
            <p>This class changed my view on web development as I now understand the amount of time and effort that is put into creating a professional looking webiste. I learned that web development is not just about coding, but also about problem-solving and designing user-friendly interfaces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
            <p>I would recommend future students to start working on their projects early and to make sure to practice a lot because all the topics from different weeks build on each other. Practicing coding regularly and reviewing course materials consistently will make the learning process smoother.</p>
